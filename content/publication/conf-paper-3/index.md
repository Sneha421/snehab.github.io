abstract: >
  Facial recognition is one of the most secure ways to identify a person. Manual attendance in organizations, 
  be it in classrooms or libraries or even attendance for teachers is truly a hassle. Due to the inception of 
  Hidden Markov Model (HMM), they have worked well with image data and it has a plethora of facial recognition 
  applications. In this paper, yet another application of face recognition with HMM is explored, where it is 
  integrated with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and tracks the attendance of the students present in a 
  database. HMMs deal with data in the form of states and sequences. Face recognition looked through the lens 
  of HMMs can be framed in the following manner: a face is split into regions vertically (forehead, chin, etc.) 
  and a particular sequence is always preserved. A rectangular window of fixed size is passed over every test 
  image, and for every vector obtained, the probability of data is calculated. For training, probability computation 
  is done with the help of the Baum-Welch algorithm. This whole model is connected to a simple program to keep track 
  of the students leaving and entering the classroom, marking their presence only and updating the same information 
  in the collegeâ€™s database.
