# summary: An example talk using Hugo Blox Builder's Markdown slides feature.
abstract: This session will demystify the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), highlighting the key differences and connections between them. It will provide a brief historical overview of AI, including the two major "AI winters," and introduce the core learning paradigmsâ€”Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. The session will also touch upon the basics of neurons, neural networks, and the role of statistics in Data Science. To bring theory into context, it will explore two compelling real-world AI applications: voice command assistants like Alexa and Siri, and self-driving cars.
