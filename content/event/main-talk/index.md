  This session will demystify the foundational concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Data Science, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep Learning (DL), highlighting their key differences and interconnections. It offers a brief historical overview of AI, including the two major AI winters, and introduces core learning paradigmsâ€”Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning. The session also touches on neurons, neural networks, and the role of statistics in Data Science. Real-world applications such as voice command assistants like Alexa and Siri, and self-driving cars, are used to contextualize the concepts discussed.
