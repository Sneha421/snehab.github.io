      subtitle: ''

        I’m deeply interested in the intersection of AI and healthcare — especially using NLP and deep learning to tackle real-world clinical challenges. 
        
        At Medtronic, I built a recommendation system for diabetes product complaints, which deepened my interest in responsible, impactful AI.

        My recent publication explores transformer-based approaches to improve OCR outputs in noisy medical text.
        
        I'm especially excited by research that bridges cutting-edge AI with practical healthcare needs.
