        Iâ€™m deeply interested in the intersection of AI and healthcareâ€”especially using NLP and deep learning to tackle real-world clinical challenges. My recent work explores

        transformer-based approaches for improving OCR outputs, and Iâ€™ve published research in NLP along these lines. Iâ€™m always excited to collaborate on meaningful projects
        
        that blend responsible AI with impactful healthcare solutions.
